          <h3>Redesigning Lotic CMS: How to enhance flexibility and streamline Content Management</h3>
          <h6>Lotic CMS Case Study | üìçProduct design at Lotic.ai</h6>
        </div>
      </div>


     <section class="Bubble2Process">
       <p>In this case study, I want to share how we solved the problem of empowering creators to streamline and simplify their content management on the Lotic CMS platform.</p>
       <p class="ilatic">To comply with my non-disclosure agreement, I have omitted and obfuscated confidential information in this case study. All information in this case study 
        is my own and does not necessarily reflect the views of Lotic.ai.</p>
       <h5>My role and the team</h5>
       <p>As the sole designer on this project, I collaborated closely with the product, development, content, and data science teams. I led the project from concept to execution, 
        taking on key responsibilities such as defining the problem and project scope, brainstorming and prioritizing features, designing the visual interface, and conducting user testing.</p>
       <p><b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarascheuermann/">Sara Scheuermann</a> </b>is my designer manager who provided support and design feedback throughout the whole project. And I also got great support from the team:</p>

       <h5>Context</h5>
       <p>Lotic CMS is a content management system where team controls all content deployment across all Lotic platforms. Currently, it serves as an internal tool for the in-house content 
        and data science teams, with future plans to expand its capabilities to external business partners looking to distribute their content across the Lotic ecosystem.</p>
       <p>You might wonder why Lotic decided to build its own CMS tool instead of opting for a third-party solution. The reasons are multifaceted. A primary factor is that third-party CMS tools 
        cannot support the complex data structure that Lotic uses in its backend. Integrating with these tools would significantly increase both cost and complexity. Additionally, Lotic aims to use 
        its CMS as a tool for data science team to manage tagging system for AI algorithm recommendation ‚Äî something third-party tools couldn't adequately support.</p>
       <p>At this stage, Lotic's primary users are the content team, whose daily tasks involve creating content, organizing it into various packages, and scheduling deployments to Lotic users.</p>

      <!--objective-->
      <h5>Objective</h5>
      <p>However, the content team found their daily experience with the current Lotic CMS to be frustrating and 
        challenging, making it difficult to complete their tasks efficiently. This poor user experience slowed down the content deployment process. 
        As a result, the goal of this project was to redesign the Lotic CMS and significantly improve the user experience, in other words, to <b>create a streamlined and simplified user experience</b>.</p>
 
     <!--Success metrics-->
     <h5>Success metrics</h5>
     <p>For this project, we identified two key success metrics: <b>user satisfaction</b> and <b>content deployment speed</b>. User satisfaction, measured through surveys, will indicate whether we've successfully enhanced 
      the user experience. Content deployment speed will reveal if the redesign has effectively accelerated the content deployment process.</p>
     
     <!--Solve the provblem-->
     <h5>Solve the problem:</h5>
     <h5>Initial feelings</h5>
     <p>When I first started the project, the PM handed me a PRD packed with an overwhelming number of requests from various teams, many of which had vague even conflicting requirements. 
      The list included numerous issues the product team wanted to address, along with several missing features that needed to be added. However, with a tight deadline and limited resources, it was clear we couldn‚Äôt 
      tackle everything, making it difficult to determine where to begin.</p>

     <!--The old CMS-->
     <h5>The old CMS</h5>
     <p>After auditing the old CMS website, it quickly became evident why users struggled with it. The UI was outdated. There are multiple sections displaying the same content causing confusion. 
      The navigation was unclear, making it difficult for users to grasp the nesting concepts and how they related to different Lotic platforms. Additionally, the system lacked flexibility, forcing users 
      to go through unnecessary steps to rearrange content.</p>

      <!--Kickoff meeting-->
      <h5>Kickoff meeting to get all stakeholders aligned</h5>
      <p>Given the numerous requests from different teams with unclear requirements, I organized a project kickoff meeting with all major stakeholders. The goal was to align everyone and clarify the vague and even 
        conflicting requirements. The meeting was very successful: we resolved conflicting requests and clarified others. Later project kickoff meetings became a standard practice in Lotic's product development process.</p>

            system-generated IDs.

          Another example of conflicting requests: The content team wanted
          to continue adding images via external links, while the product
          team preferred to avoid external links due to potential
          unpredictable behavior in the backend.

      Following the kickoff meeting, I conducted a series of individual
      interviews with each stakeholder and CMS users, including the content
      and data science teams. These interviews helped me understand the
      rationale behind each request and allowed me to further refine the
      project requirements.

          Rationale behind:<br />&quot;Before entering anything into the
          CMS, I prepare everything in a spreadsheet where all items are
          created and organized. However, since the CMS generates IDs
          automatically, I have to manually update the IDs in the
          spreadsheet, which is time-consuming.&quot; ‚Äî The user isn&#x27;t
          actually asking to edit the ID; instead, they want to ensure both
          systems are aligned with the same numbers.<br />

    <h5>Nested data structure in the backend</h5>
    <p>One of the key challenges in this project was designing a system that could support the complex data structure 
      in the backend. Since Lotic CMS serves as the platform for content deployment across all other Lotic platforms, it needed to align with how the data is organized.</p>
    <p>Through discussions with the data science team, I learned that the data is structured into three hierarchies: Sequence > Package > Post.</p>

        <p>One major issue with the old CMS was its lack of intuitiveness in showing how users

        <h5>Competitor Analysis</h5>
        <p>I conducted a competitor analysis on the leading CMS products in the market, including Web CMS, WordPress, HubSpot CMS Hub, 
          WiX, Ghost, Strapi, and Hygraph. My research focused on the following key aspects:</p>
        <p>- Core features and functionality<br>
          - Interface design<br>
          - Integration between the CMS and various platforms</p>
        <p>Throughout the research, I paid particular attention to how these platforms structure their interfaces to give user a streamlined experience, 
          like allowing users to easily create, manage, and deploy content. Here are some insights I gained from the competitor analysis:</p>
        <p>- Most of the platforms only support a single layer of content, meaning they do not accommodate a nested structure. As a result, they offer little guidance on how to manage the hierarchical data.<br>
          - They addressed the flexibility challenge by introducing ‚ÄòBlocks‚Äô‚Äîa versatile editing unit that supports multiple media types.<br>
          - Some features like the live content preview function will facilitate the content creation and deployment speed.</p>

        <h5>Information Architecture</h5>
        <h5>Pain points</h5>
        <p>By gathering all the insights from research and interviews, I had a brainstorming meeting with the product manager to prioritize the key pain points. Here are the top 3 pain points that we agreed on:</p>
        <figure

      >
        <div style="font-size: 1.5em"><span class="icon">ü§úüèª</span></div>
        <div style="width: 100%">

            <li style="list-style-type: disc">
              hierarchy of data is confusing and it isn‚Äôt reflected clearly in
              CMS.<br />e.g. flat structure vs content in different levels
              (Sequence &gt; Package &gt; Post)<br />
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul id="ac32dd4d-87f3-4fcf-aa50-dc3be3625abf" class="bulleted-list">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc">
              The current content creation flow only supports one direction in
              the data hierarchy: Post ‚Üí Package ‚Üí Sequence, whereas the
              content team prefers the flow to follow Sequence ‚Üí Package ‚Üí
              Post which is not supported.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul id="a317b4f6-7bb3-4e00-b2fd-dca5c748e6f7" class="bulleted-list">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc">

            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </figure>

      <h5>User flow and site map</h5>
      <p>I analyzed the existing user flow, which helped me identify key pain points and inefficiencies in the content management process. 
        It also revealed why users were limited to creating content in only one direction (Post ‚Üí Package ‚Üí Sequence). I then redesigned the flow to streamline the process, 
        making content creation, management, and deployment more intuitive and efficient while accounting for the complex nested structure. This new user flow supports bi-direction 
        creation and has reduced steps to create the content in the nested structure.</p>
      <p>Here is a comparison between old and new user flow of how user create content in nested structure:</p>
      <img src="image/CMS_userflow.png" alt="Image">
      <p>At the same time, to improve navigation and content organization, I also analyzed the existing site map, identifying areas of complexity and redundancy. Here is a comparison between the old and new site map:</p>
      <img src="image/CMS_oldsitemap.png" alt="Image">
      <img src="image/CMS_newsitemap.png" alt="Image">

      <h5>Wireframe and user testing</h5>
      <p>Creating a wireframe without focusing on detailed UI design allows me to quickly develop the layout, prioritizing functionality over aesthetics. Thus I was able to conduct moderated user testing on its prototype and gather user feedback early in the process.</p>
      <img src="image/CMS_wireframe.png" alt="Image">
      <figcaption>Wireframe</figcaption>
      <p>One of the key pieces of feedback I received from the user testing was that users greatly appreciated the flexibility to create content in either direction‚Äîwhether starting from a lower level and building up
         (Post ‚Üí Package ‚Üí Sequence) or beginning at a higher level and working down (Sequence ‚Üí Package ‚Üí Post). This flexibility allowed users to tailor the content creation process to their specific needs and workflows, making the system more intuitive and efficient for diverse use cases.</p>

      <h5>Visual designs</h5>
      <p>With the new design system I created (details provided below), I was able to proceed with designing the high-fidelity mockups.</p>
      <p>The new CMS is organized into the following sections:</p>
      <p>Part 1 - Dashboard: A new section where users can monitor incomplete drafts awaiting publication, track space usage, access tutorials, and view recent activities. I plan to discuss the design process for this page in a separate case study.</p>
      <img src="image/CMS_dashboard.png" alt="Image">
      <figcaption>Dashboard</figcaption>

      <p>Part 2 - Content Creation Section: This area encompasses three content hierarchies‚ÄîSequence, Package, and Post (referred to as Activity in the new CMS).</p>
      <p>In designing this section, I focused on providing users with greater flexibility to create content across different hierarchies.</p>
      <p>a, A unified starting point</p>
      <p>Users can now begin content creation from a single location‚Äîthe "Create" button‚Äîrather than navigating to different sections. In the new CMS, all content, regardless of its level, is treated as a singular unit called a 'Page.' It aims to simplify the user experience and reduce the time required to create various types of content.</p>
      <img src="image/CMS_create.png" alt="Image">
      <figcaption>Create Page</figcaption>

      <p>b, Support content creation in both directions</p>
      <p>In the old CMS, users had to prepare all Activity-level content before they could aggregate it into Package and Sequence levels. The new CMS supports both directions, allowing users to start by setting up the Sequence page first, then create or select an existing Package, and finally create or choose the Activity/Post content. It is better aligned with user behavior, as revealed through user interviews.</p>
      <img src="image/CMS_Sequencehierarchy.png" alt="Image">
      <figcaption>User can create a Package Page directly inside the Sequence Page</figcaption>
      <img src="image/CMS_Packagehierarchy.png" alt="Image">
      <figcaption>User can create a Activity/Post Page directly inside the Package Page</figcaption>

      <p>c, Clear visual representation of data Hierarchies</p>
      <p>The new CMS features multiple areas where the data hierarchy is visually represented, allowing users to easily understand the flow of created content. This provides a clear overview, helping users grasp the bigger picture without getting lost in the details.</p>
      <img src="image/CMS_navigation.png" alt="Image">

      <img src="image/CMS_linkingsection.png" alt="Image">
      <figcaption>The section inside the content page which shows the nested structure</figcaption>

      <p>d, Introduce ‚ÄòBlock‚Äô as the basic editing tool</p>
      <p>In the new CMS, I introduced ‚ÄòBlock‚Äô which enables users to add and rearrange various types of media, such as text, images, and videos, with ease and flexibility.</p>
      <img src="image/CMS_block.png" alt="Image">
      <figcaption>Block varies depending on the type of the page</figcaption>

      <p>Part 3 - Other sections to support requested features: Library, Tag, etc.</p>
      <img src="image/CMS_tag.png" alt="Image">
      <figcaption>Tag</figcaption>

      <h5>Design library</h5>
      <p>One of the key requests was to design a design system for the CMS website. After discussing with the engineering team, we decided to base the system on the Material UI library (MUI), customizing it to meet the specific needs of the CMS. The main challenge was ensuring that the CMS design system remained consistent with Lotic‚Äôs existing design system.</p>
      <p>To ensure consistency across design systems while meeting the needs of the CMS, I took the following steps:<br>

        - Foundations: I adjusted typography, color schemes, spacing, and other elements of MUI to align with Lotic‚Äôs style guide.<br>
        - Custom Components: I developed customized pre-built components for the CMS, building on the foundation of MUI to suit its specific requirements.</p>
        <img src="image/CMS_designsystem.png" alt="Image">
        <figcaption>Design library</figcaption>

      <h5>Result</h5>
      <p>After the website went live, the following metrics were achieved:<br>

        - Increased User Satisfaction: User surveys indicated higher satisfaction with the new CMS.<br>
        - Improved Content Deployment Speed: The new CMS demonstrated a 40% increase in content deployment speed on average.</p>
      
      <h5>Learning</h5>
      <p>1, Tackling ambiguity</p>
      <p>One of the biggest challenges in this project was navigating through ambiguity, especially at the beginning. I felt overwhelmed and even didn‚Äôt know where to start by reading the PRD filled 
        with numerous vague and conflicting requests. By organizing a project kickoff meeting, conducting rounds of individual interviews with stakeholders and holding regular design reviews, I was able 
        to clarify the requirements and align everyone on the same page.</p>
      <p>2, Effective communication & stakeholder management</p>
      <p>Throughout the project, clear and consistent communication was key to success. From collaborating closely with the product manager during brainstorming sessions to discussing technical requirements 
        with the engineering and data science teams, effective communication played a crucial role in keeping everyone aligned. I‚Äôve learnt the value of maintaining open communication across all teams involved in this project.</p>
      <p>3, Complex data structure</p>
      <p>Designing the CMS that supports a complex data hierarchy was a valuable learning experience to me. It was also my first time closely collaborating with the data science team to understand how data is structured in the backend, which greatly informed and improved the design.</p>

      <h5>Parting words</h5>
      <p>While working on this project, I really enjoyed collaborating within a cross-functional team, where diverse expertise and perspectives came together to create a great product. Here are some words from my team:</p>
