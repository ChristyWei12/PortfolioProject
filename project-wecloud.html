            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Nowadays the cloud storage and organization product is becoming more and more popular,
            however, most of the existing products are too complicated - users often find it hard to
            organize the files due to complexity of the structure, or lacking fun to use - the UI is
            looking too serious and formal.</p>

            <p>WeCloud wants to blow a new fresh air into this field providing a more colorful, relaxing

            <h3>User Survey</h3>
            <p>User survey is helping me better understand on how people think about the cloud management
              market and what is their real desire. Surveys are sent out via Google Forms. Keys questions
              are listed as below:</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="question">What cloud management product do they use?<br>What features do they use most?<br>
What are the deterrents that make them look for another app/website?<br>How do they like to share the file?<br>Are they using these kind of product for personal or business use?</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Here are some key insights from survey:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p4>89%</p4>

              <li>
                <p4>96%</p4>
                <h6>of attendees use the website/app to upload files to the cloud</h6>

                <p4>76%</p4>
                <h6>of attendees will stop using the product if there is no free space or very limited space provided</h6>

            <p>User survey provides a good basis for creating the user personas. 2 distinct groups are identified among
              survey attendees:</p>
            <p>the student group who are studying in university or graduate school and have the need to save files and
             share with others for academic projects; </p>
            <p>the business professionals who are working in a company and have needs to process work files and also collaborate with others at work.</p>

            <h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
            <p>The competition in the cloud content management market is very fierce and many big brands are stepping into this field.
              I did a competitive Analysis of Google Drive, Dropbox and Egnyte, which are the big players in the market and got insights
              in Visual Design, User Flow, Brand & Logo design etc.</p>

            <p style="color:#ffffff;">Branding is a big challenge for me. It is very important to give the product a special name that is attractive and easy to
              remember, and at the same time expresses the meaning that can help people organize their files and connect with others. Here
              is the mind map for brainstorming.</p>
            <p style="color:#ffffff;">Among all the concepts above, I decided to choose WeCloud as the brand name. “Cloud” indicates the cloud space where files can be saved and shared
              and “We” indicates the collaboration between people.</p>

            <p style="color:#ffffff;">After the brand name got determined, I started sketching the logo. The logo is expected to deliver the sharing spirit as well as a fun and pleasant feeling.</p>

              using as logo font delivers the brand characteristic as being modern, clean and pleasant.
