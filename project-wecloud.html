            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Nowadays the cloud storage and organization product is becoming more and more popular,
            however, most of the existing products are too complicated - users often find it hard to
            organize the files due to complexity of the structure, or lacking fun to use - the UI is
            looking too serious and formal.</p>

            <h3>User Survey</h3>
            <p>User survey is helping me better understand on how people think about the cloud management
              market and what is their real desire. Surveys are sent out via Google Forms. Keys questions
              are listed as below:</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="question">What cloud management product do they use?<br>What features do they use most?<br>
What are the deterrents that make them look for another app/website?<br>How do they like to share the file?<br>Are they using these kind of product for personal or business use?</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Here are some key insights from survey:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p4>89%</p4>
                <h6>of attendees have experience using cloud content management website/app</h6>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p4>96%</p4>
                <h6>of attendees use the website/app to upload files to the cloud</h6>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p4>76%</p4>
                <h6>of attendees will stop using the product if there is no free space or very limited space provided</h6>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p4>64%</p4>
                <h6>of attendees would like to share the files via link</h6>

            <h3>Personas</h3>
            <p>User survey provides a good basis for creating the user personas. 2 distinct groups are identified among
              survey attendees:</p>
            <p>the student group who are studying in university or graduate school and have the need to save files and
             share with others for academic projects; </p>
            <p>the business professionals who are working in a company and have needs to process work files and also collaborate with others at work.</p>

            <h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
            <p>The competition in the cloud content management market is very fierce and many big brands are stepping into this field.
