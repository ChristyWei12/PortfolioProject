          <p style="color:#ffffff;">There are a few trends of note: 54% of the world’s population live in urban communities, the average marriage age for men is 29 (up from 26 two decades ago)
            and for women is 27 (up from 23 in the same time period). Given these trends, city dwellers tend to spend most of their twenties living with roommates. Finding and keeping a good
            roommate, however, gets harder as more and more people live in cities.</p>

          <img class="icon" src="image/logo/Interface-Essential/Login/logout/login-key.svg" alt="icon">
          <h3 style="color:#ffffff;">Solution</h3>
          <p style="color:#ffffff;">RooMate is a roommate-seeker app, which helps people find, match, and communicate with future roommates. People can either post on RooMate or search others’ posts
            to find the ideal roommate. At the same, RooMate is also matching roommates basing on people’s preference automatically. The goal is to streamline the roommate matching process and make it easier, faster and more fun.</p>

          <h3>User Interview</h3>
          <p>Interviews are conducted to help me have a better understanding of the survey results as well as develop empathy for users.
            I selected people who can represent different groups which are identified in the surveys. The following empathy map shows how
            one of the interviewees, BB, thinks, feels, says and does.</p>
