          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>There are a few trends of note: 54% of the world’s population live in urban communities, the average marriage age for men is 29 (up from 26 two decades ago)
            and for women is 27 (up from 23 in the same time period). Given these trends, city dwellers tend to spend most of their twenties living with roommates. Finding and keeping a good
            roommate, however, gets harder as more and more people live in cities.</p>

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>RooMate is a roommate-seeker app, which helps people find, match, and communicate with future roommates. People can either post on RooMate or search others’ posts
            to find the ideal roommate. At the same, RooMate is also matching roommates basing on people’s preference automatically. The goal is to streamline the roommate matching process and make it easier, faster and more fun.</p>

            <img class="icon" src="image/logo/Interface-Essential/Dashboard/pie-line-graph.svg" alt="icon">
            <h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
            <p>To see where RooMate stands in the roommate-finding and house renting market, I selected 3 competitors, which are Roomi, RoomEasy and Airbnb.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Brand">
            <div class="RR">
             <div class="logoset">
              <img class="Roomi" src="image/logo/Roomi.svg" alt="Roomi">
              <img class="RoomEasy" src="image/logo/RoomEasy.svg" alt="RoomEasy">
            </div>
              <p>Roomi and RoomEasy are focusing on helping people find roommates for long terms either by algorithm or manually. However, their brand awareness
              is very low per the suvery results showed and it leaves a big market for RooMate to explore and also insights on future marketing promotion strategy.</p>
            </div>
          <div class="Airbnb">
            <img src="image/logo/Airbnb.svg" alt="Airbnb">
            <p>Airbnb, on the other hand, starts its ideas from sharing the spare room with strangers, mostly short term. However, now Airbnb is sort of deviating from its
              original model and focusing more on creating different and better (even luxurious) experiences to travelers and not surprisingly, travelers are somewhat spoiled.
              They are expecting more service and better quality from Airbnb, and some of them no longer want to share room with others.</p>

           <h3>Identity</h3>
           <p>At this point, I did a mind map brain-storming all the concepts which came to my mind. Here are some concepts:</p>
         </div>
          <ul class="part2" style="color:#ffffff;">
            <li><h5>NextRoom:</h5></li>
            <li><p>It reminds people to use the app to find the next room</p></li>
            <li><h5>ShareRoom:</h5><li>
            <li><p>The app enables people to better share the room</p></li>
            <li><h5>RentSplit:</h5></li>
            <li><p>People is able to split the rent with roommates</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p style="color:#ffffff;">There are also other concepts, however, I decided to choose RooMate which explictly and directly reminds people of finding roommates. And it is easy to memorize.</p>

          <h3 style="color:#ffffff;">Logo</h3>
          <p style="color:#ffffff;">After the brand name got determined, I started sketching the logo. The logo is expected to combine the meaning of house/room and sharing spirit. It is expected to express itsself to be fun, collaborative and modern.</p>

            <p>Since one of the testers gave up in Task 4 by missing the roommate tab, I will consider to make it the same obvious to user as the housing tab by using similar icons, text and layout.</p>

            they can have a profile page that they can do the settings about themselves and preference towards future roommate, which can help our system quickly match the room or roommate
            and put the related posts to front when they browse post.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>When doing the user research, I found out that people are actually very concerned about the background check of potential roommate. The trust issue, if not handled well, might destroy
          all the good user experience. So if I had more time on this project, I would focus more on how to make people feel secured and comfortable on RooMate. For example, it can require users
          to submit more identity related information when they are posting.
Another point that can improve in future is keeping out the spam or fake post. It can be done by verifying the authenticity of the address, and adding more interactions between users, e.g. exploring online open house tour etc.</p>
