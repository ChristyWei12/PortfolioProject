        <h3>What is RooMate?</h3>
        <p>RooMate is the Capstone project I did independently while studying in the <a class="thinkful" href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful/Bloc</a> Design Program.
          User-centered design mindset is applied throughout the design process from user research to A/B preference testing to usability testing on a hi-fi interactive prototype. It takes 3 months to complete the project.</p>
        <p>At the background of a highly expanding urban population and late marriage age, RooMate app is aiming to help people, especially millennials living in cities, find ideal roommates.</p>

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>There are a few trends of note: 54% of the worldâ€™s population live in urban communities, the average marriage age for men is 29
          (up from 26 two decades ago) and for women is 27 (up from 23 in the same time period). Given these trends, city dwellers tend to
          spend most of their twenties living with roommates. Finding and keeping a good roommate, however, gets harder as more and more people live in cities.</p>

          <p>RooMate is a roommate-seeker app, which helps people find, match, and communicate with future roommates.
            People can either post on RooMate or search othersâ€™ posts to find the ideal roommate. At the same, RooMate
            is also matching roommates based on peopleâ€™s preference automatically. The goal is to streamline the roommate
            matching process and make it easier, safer and more fun.</p>

          <img class="Line" src="image/Line.svg" alt="dividing line">
          <p>Before diving into user research, there are some hypotheses that can be validated by the later research result:</p>
          <p class="assumption"> - It is not easy to find an ideal roommate and people tend to seek help from others.<br>
             - People tend to trust whom they feel reliable and touchable.<br>
             - The more information (including photos, videos) provided, the more reliable and trustful people will feel towards others.<br>
             - People wonâ€™t feel safe if their contact information is disclosed publicly, especially phone numbers.<br>
             - From privacy purpose, people do not want to share their social media account</p>
          <p>User Research is conducted to further refine the problem statement, validate the assumptions listed above, dig into the unique
            needs of people whom Iâ€™m designing for, understand their pain point and define the audience. Research findings become a touchstone
            for ensuring that creative and aesthetic decisions are being made objectively later .In this project, I conducted the user survey and user interview. </p>

            people who is renting out place and seeking roommates, and owns the property; people who is renting a place and seeking roommates<br> - The 3 groups all care about some common habits of roommates when living together but at different tolerance level<br>
           - Users donâ€™t use roommate-finder app because they have never heard of such apps<br> - Users are not reluctant to link their social accounts as long as they have control of the access level</p>

            <p>To see where RooMate stands in the roommate-seeking and house-sharing market, I selected 4 competitors, which are Roomi, RoomEasy, Airbnb and Craigslist. Among these competitors, Roomi and
              RoomEasy are direct competitors who have similar product offerings, and Airbnb and Craigslist are indirect competitors who have certain sections serve the similar purpose.</p>

          <p>Main Takeaways:<br> - There is a huge demand in the market for the roommate-seeking app among strangers other than family and friends. The popularity of Craigslist and Airbnb can reflect this demand<br>
            - People are expecting their privacy to be protected. The popularity of in-app chat reflects this trend.<br>

          <ul class="part2">

            <p style="color:#ffffff;">After the brand name got determined, I started sketching the logo. The logo is expected to

         <p class="bold">If given more time, what I will do ...</p>
         <p>When doing the user research, I found out that people are very concerned about the background check of potential roommates. The trust issue, if not handled well, might destroy
          all the good user experience. So if I had more time on this project, I would focus more on how to make people feel secure and comfortable on RooMate. For example, it can require users
          to submit more identity related information when they are posting.
Another way that can improve people's trust level in future is keeping out the spam or fake post. It can be done by verifying the authenticity of the address, and adding more interactions between users, e.g. exploring online open house tours etc.</p>

          <p> - Design process is not a linear process, but full of iterations<br>
 - Design is â€˜not about youâ€™, but about business and users<br>
 - Love testing! Always test the design and revise based on the results<br>
 - Be research-informed (as much as possible)
