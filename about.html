          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>Hey, I am Christy Wei, a UX designer based in the San Francisco bay area,
            California. I believe in the power of design which can make our life easier
            and more pleasurable.</p>

          <h2>Why I love UX Design?</h2>
          <p>Sometimes there is no reason why you are passionate about something.
            You just love it from the first sight, you enjoy it, and you want to spend
            countless hours on it and you will feel achievement and satisfaction.
            Sometimes it feels like it is inherent in your blood. For me, this thing
            is UX design.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="background">
          <h2>A little about my background</h2>
          <p>Before I found UX design, I have been trying to explore different possibilities
            from the every angle of my life to find the thing that I am really passionate about:
            I learned dancing for 4 years that enabled me to enjoy the charm of music; I was an
            illustrator intern for a local newspaper while in school and I started to find my
            passion on sketching and paintings; I like traveling to explore various lifestyle,
            make new friends and document it through my camera; I majored in Philosophy in university
            which makes me form the habit of thinking and tend to dig deeper into people’s inner
            feelings and thoughts and stay empathetic; studying data analytics major in my graduate
            school and working as an audit specialist helps me build the analytical skills and forces
            me to make conclusions that need to be supported by data. Then I joined the Smart Closet
            Team where I met UX Design.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Startup Experiences">
          <h2>Startup Experiences: Smart Closet</h2>
          <p>Smart Closet is a virtual closet mobile platform where people can make outfit looks,
            shop new items and share their fashion collage with others. In the team, I am responsible
            for marketing, PR as well as customer relationships management. In my daily work, I spent
            a lot of time talking to our users, collecting their feedback and putting insights into the
            design improvement. I am not a UX designer for Smart Closet though, but I have the opportunity
            to work in user research and work together with the engineer team to make the user experience
            much easier and full of fun. The more I got involved in optimizing the design, the more I enjoyed
            it. The way that we can make a difference in people's life -- make their life easier and more
            pleasurable -- gives me a sense of achievement. From this experience, UX design stepped into my
            life and successfully attracted my attention.</p>

        <div class="journey">
          <h2>A new journey now starts</h2>
          <p>I know making a career change requires a big commitment so I joined the Bloc UX Design Apprentice
            Program to systematically study UX Design. After months of studying and working on projects, I was
            able to combine my passion for design with the analytical skills I gained in the past to become a
            creative problem solver. From learning UX fundamentals, to developing the visual skills, to learn
            front-end development skills, e.g. HTML, CSS, Javascript etc, I am happy to see myself gradually grow
            up to be a real and professional designer. I am excited to start a new journey as a UX designer to
            make people’s life easier and more pleasurable.</p>
