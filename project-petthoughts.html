          <h3>What is PetThoughts?</h3>
          <p>PetThoughts app is a smart camera designed for pet owners. By using PetThoughts app, pet owners can use various AI lenses to capture their daily life with their furry friend,
            choose different editing tools like captions, watermarks, programmatic stickers, voiceover to add their thoughts into the video and use galaxy sendto page to share with family
            and friends. Different from the iOS system phone, it focuses on creativeness and self-expressiveness of the camera via AI technology.</p>
          <!--<h3>PetThoughts and Youpi</h3>
          <p>With the mission to help people better express and communicate with each other in the virtual world via video technology, Youpi explores different camera products focusing on
            different groups of people and use cases. The PetThoughts app is the first product that our team is exploring to unlock the possibilities of cameras with a focus on the pet community.</p>-->
          <h3>Why focus on pet community?</h3>
          <p>As we observed from tons of short-form videos online, pets are a hot topic that people like to express their life via camera and the pet community is growing fast especially since the Pandemic. However, there is
            no successful camera designed for this group yet. Our team would like to create a smart pet camera that pet owners can quickly capture the pet moment and share with anyone across different platforms.</p>

        <h3>The Team, The Role, The Project</h3>
        <p>Youpi Inc. is an early-stage startup based in the San Francisco Bay Area, invested by top VCs including Index Ventures. I joined Youpi team in early 2021 as the founding designer.
          I am leading complex design projects on designing expressive & interactive camera experience and immersive social video experience.</p>
        <p>PetThoughts is the first product in Youpi. Starting from initial ideas, it took 5 months for the app to be launched in Australia AppStore. My responsibility includes:</p>

      <section class="ProblemSolution">
        <div class="Problem">
          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>Nowadays short-form video is becoming a phenomenal product in personal entertainment. It provides people a richer way of expression than text and photos. However, after talking
            to some pet owners, we found that pet owners don't often record their life and express themselves via making videos. Thus a major problem that PetThoughts app tries to solve is:</p>
            <h5>"How to encourage pet owners to take videos and express their pet life?"</h5>
          <p>The major problem can be further broken down into different smaller questions:<br>
          1, From content creation perspective: what content can we encourage pet owners to create?<br>
          2, From the flow perspective: how to make video creation process easy and fast?<br>
          3, From the memories saving perspective: how can we help pet owners easily save all videos in one place?
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="Solution">
          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>Here are different solutions to solve the problem:<br>
            1, From content creation perspective: Pet video personification, i.e. provide a way to let pet owners personify their pet and create interesting videos.<br>
            2, From the flow perspective: introduce programmatic stickers to make the video creation flow easier.<br>
            3, From the memories saving perspective: a searchable timeline view of memories will help pet owners better organize all videos thus providing an incentive to use PetThoughts to create videos.
</p>
          <h5 class="emphasize">In this case study, I will focus on how we explore the first solution: pet video personification.</h5>

        <p>Being able to test product ideas among potential users at early stage of the design flow is very critical to startup like us who has limited engineer resources but tries to find the product market fit.
          How to get the users' feedback as early as possible, even without much engineer efforts, is the key to deciding the right product direction and feature selection. Due to the limited engineering bandwidth,
        the team would need to try different ways to get users' feedback before handing over the design to the eng team. Below are different ways our team is exploring to get users' opinions.</p>

          <p>Suggested AI: PetThoughts app is leveraging Youpi's AI technology and provides suggested popular pet memes for video creation. It can help pet owners
          quickly get inspirations on what's going on inside their pet's mind (e.g. personify pet thoughts) and encourage them to create more content.</p>
          <p>Activity Lens: Activity Lens is a pre-set video template with different combinations of camera & editing features. It helps pet owners quickly create trending videos without being video experts.</p>
          <p>Pet Face Detection: This camera lens will detect a dog's or cat's face and pop up suggested captions to personify pet videos.</p>

          <p>TikTok & Snapchat camera is a canvas, which looks for artists to showcase the art. PetThoughts camera is a keyboard instead, which looks for people to type their stories. We are exploring the possibilities
          that anything on the screen can be a key for you to tap. The first step is to allow video creators to tap pixels to add captions and speech bubbles.</p>

          prompt message right after people open the camera page can help them quickly pass that cold-start stage and get to use the camera for video creation.</p>

            people to express themselves and interact with others. After runs of user research and idea testing, we select interactive bubbles to be one way to capture the interactions between pet and pet owners.</p>
