          <h5>What is PetThoughts?</h5>
          <p>PetThoughts app is a smart camera designed for pet owners. By using PetThoughts app, pet owners can use various AI lenses to capture their daily life with their furry friend,
            choose different editing tools like captions, watermarks, programmatic stickers, voiceover to add their thoughts into the video and use galaxy sendto page to share with family
            and friends. Different from the iOS system phone, it focuses on creativeness and self-expressiveness of the camera via AI technology.</p>
          <!--<h3>PetThoughts and Youpi</h3>
          <p>With the mission to help people better express and communicate with each other in the virtual world via video technology, Youpi explores different camera products focusing on
            different groups of people and use cases. The PetThoughts app is the first product that our team is exploring to unlock the possibilities of cameras with a focus on the pet community.</p>-->
          <h5>The pet community</h5>
          <p>As we observed from tons of short-form videos online, pets are a hot topic that people like to express their life via camera and the pet community is growing fast especially since the Pandemic. However, there is
            no successful camera designed for this group yet. Our team would like to create a smart pet camera that pet owners can quickly capture the pet moment and share with anyone across different platforms.</p>

          <h5>The Problem</h5>
          <p>Nowadays short-form video is becoming a phenomenal product in personal entertainment. It provides people a richer way of expression than text and photos. However, after talking
            to some pet owners, we found that pet owners don't often record their life and express themselves via making videos. Thus a major problem that PetThoughts app tries to solve is:</p>
            <p class="quote">"How to encourage pet owners to take videos and express their pet life?"</p>
          <p>The major problem can be further broken down into different smaller questions:<br>
          1, From the <b>creation flow perspective</b>: how to make video creation process easy and fast?<br>
          2, From <b>content creation perspective</b>: what content can we encourage pet owners to create?<br>
          3, From the <b>utility value perspective</b>: how can we help pet owners easily save all videos in one place?
        </p>
        <h5>The Solution</h5>
        <p>Here are some solutions that PetThoughts app tries to tackle the problem:<br>
          1, From the <b>creation flow</b> perspective: simplify creation process.<br>
          2, From <b>content creation perspective</b>: add AI suggestions into creation process.<br>
          3, From the <b>utility value perspective</b>: provide a searchable timeline view of memories will help pet owners better organize all videos in one place.

          How to get the users' feedback as early as possible, even without much engineer efforts, is the key to deciding the right product direction and feature selection. Due to the limited engineering bandwidth,
        the team would need to try different ways to get users' feedback before handing over the design to the eng team. Below are different ways our team is exploring to get users' opinions.</p>

       <p>When designing the camera creation flow, I have been spending a lot of time on simplifying the whole process. After rounds of iterations, the whole process has been reduced from 5 steps to 4 steps and become smoother and one-hand friendly.</p>
       <p>Following changes have been made:<br>
         &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp- Introduce camera's 'Instant Mode' by allowing users to long press the camera button to speed up the process;<br>
         &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp- Move down 'Next' button in Editing Page and Sendto Page to create an one-hand-friendly experience;<br>
         &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp- Change 'camera' icon to 'Done' button to reduce confusion at this step.
